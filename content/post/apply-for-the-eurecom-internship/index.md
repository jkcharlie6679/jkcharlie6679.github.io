## Schedule for Applying for the EURECOM Internship

- **Ask the teacher to negotiate the internship at EURECOM**

  Prepare the English CV to the teacher for teacher negotiating the internship with the professor who at EURECOM

- **HR send the file named "2B-STAGIAIRE_Formulaire accueil" for filling the basic information**

  After confirming the internship, you will receive the EURECOM HR email. The file will need to be filled up with your basic information. At the same time, you must buy the airplane ticket, book the room where you will stay in France, and buy the insurance.

  For tickets, I recommend buying a round-trip ticket as it will be cheaper. I bought a ticket for the emirates about a 20-hour flight. You can choose a few days before and after the date to find the cheapest air ticket.

  For the room in France, there are two ways to book in usual. One is booking on Airbnb, which can reduce some administrative processes such as home insurance, guarantee, etc. Another is booking the room on the website from EURECOM named [Studapart](https://eurecom.studapart.com/en/). The second need to pay some fee for the platform and deal with the guarantee problem.

  Insurance will be used on the internship agreement and the application for the VISA. The period of insurance needs to cover the period of internships and include medical insurance and personal liability. I bought the insurance from Fubon named "一期築夢". The insurance needs to obey the rule of the Schengen Area.

- **Receive the internship agreement and run the signature process**

  After sending back the "2B" file, you will receive the internship agreement. You need to run the process for signature.

- **Receive the original internship agreement and invitation letter**

  After sending back the internship agreement, HR will send the original internship agreement and invitation letter to you by UPS. At the same time, HR will send your internship agreement to Franch Authorities for validation.

- **Receive the validation of agreement internship from Franch Authorities**

  After the validation, you will receive the validation from HR.

- **Apply for the VISA**

  You need to go to the [website](https://france-taipei.org/-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87-) of the French Office in Taipei to apply for the VISA.

- **Apply for the go-aborad internship permission (military service)**

  If you are male and have a military service problem, you need to apply for the go-aborad internship permission by the school.

## Suggestion

Please start to deal with these processes at least 2.5 months before the date you want to go for the internship. In my experience is very urgent. It will not be a good sample for you to follow my schedule. Everything may delay and will break your schedule.

At the end of this blog, I need to thank any people who give me a hand when I dealing with this process. The process will not be easy for the first time. After I get help from my friend, I need to share these experiences with anyone who wants to apply for the internship at EURECOM. Very welcome to contact me, if you meet some problems.
